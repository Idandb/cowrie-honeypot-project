KB002: Troubleshooting Offline Printer Issues
--------------------------------------------
1. Check printer power: Ensure printer is turned on and status lights are normal (no error indicators).
2. Check physical connections: Verify USB or network cable is securely connected to both printer and PC/network port.
3. Restart printer and computer: Turn off printer, wait 30 seconds, turn it back on. Restart your computer.
4. Check print queue: Open print queue on your computer, cancel any stuck print jobs.
5. Ping printer IP (for network printers): If known, try to ping the printer's IP address. If no reply, there might be a network issue.
   - Common printer IPs: 192.168.1.200, 192.168.1.201
6. Reinstall printer drivers: As a last resort, try removing and reinstalling the printer drivers from the manufacturer's website or company intranet.
7. If problem persists, note down printer model, error messages, and steps taken, then contact IT Support.
